# Mini java compiler 
## Description: 
This project implements a basic Java compiler that performs lexical and syntax analysis on Java code. 
It can:
- Read Java source code from a file.
- Tokenize the code by splitting it into individual lexemes (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
- Classify each lexeme into its corresponding type (e.g., keyword, identifier, literal).
- Perform basic syntax analysis to check for matching braces and parentheses.
- Create a symbol table containing information about each identifier encountered in the code.
## Features:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (basic)
- Symbol table generation
## Limitations:
This is a basic compiler and does not perform full semantic analysis or code generation.
It only supports a limited subset of the Java language.
